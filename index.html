		<p>Here you can explore the Mandelbrot and Julia fractals, see
		the equations behind the scenes, and the calculations used to
		render them. A fun little project devised to explore how the
		current web can handle data visualization and some heafty
		number crunching. Formatting equations TeX style is pretty
		cool too!</p>

			<p>Fractals are interesting to look at, with their fascination
			mixture of complexity and structure.  From sea-horses to
			lightning bolts, the emergent patterns often reflect those
			observed in nature.</p>
			<p>All of the Mandelbrot and Julia fractal detail comes from the following iterative equation:
			<math mode=display>
				<msub><mi>z</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub> <mo>=</mo> <msup><msub><mi>z</mi><mi>n</mi></msub> <mn>2</mn></msup> <mo>+</mo> <mi>c</mi>

			<p>All grid lines represent one unit.  The x-axis is
			real-numbers, and the y-axis is imaginary numbers.  The
			center of the graphs is the point (0 + 0·i), the top right
			is (2 + 2·i), and the bottom left is (-2 - 2·i). The graphs
			on the right show each step of the iterative calculation.
			The red circle has a radius of 2, any iterative step that
			exceeds this magnitude is guaranteed to diverge.</p>

			<p>Mouse-over the Mandelbrot graph to reveal the iterative
			calcualtions for the point under your cursor.  For each
			iteration a line is drawn on the smaller graphs to the
			right.  When you mouse-over the black region the equation
			does not diverge, so the lines will always stay with the red
			boundaries.</p>

			<p>Click on the Mandelbrot set to re-draw a new Julia Set
			for the corresponding constant "c" value.  The Julia Set
			pattern will resemble the pattern in the small area around
			where you click.  </p>

			<header><h2>About</h2></header>
			<p>From <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal>Wikipedia/Fractal</a>:
			<blockquote cite=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal > A
			fractal has been defined as "a rough or fragmented geometric
            shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least
            approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole," a property
            called self-similarity. Roots of the idea of fractals go back
            to the 17th century, while mathematically rigorous treatment
            of fractals can be traced back to functions studied by Karl
            Weierstrass, Georg Cantor and Felix Hausdorff a century later
            in studying functions that were continuous but not
            differentiable; however, the term fractal was coined by Benoît
            Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin frāctus
            meaning "broken" or "fractured." A mathematical fractal is
            based on an equation that undergoes iteration, a form of
            feedback based on recursion. There are several examples of
            fractals, which are defined as portraying exact
            self-similarity, quasi self-similarity, or statistical
            self-similarity. While fractals are a mathematical construct,
            they are found in nature, which has led to their inclusion in
            artwork. They are useful in medicine, soil mechanics,
            seismology, and technical analysis.

			<p>A calculations performed in the browser using JavaScript
			and the canvas element. View
			the <a href=fractal.js>JavaScript Code</a> and
			the <a href=fractal.html.txt>HTML Text</a>.</p>
			<p>The rendering speed is relatively slow, but useable.
			Despite having (getting?) to learn JavaSctip and the canvas
			element, overall this demo was quick to implement and easy
			to deploy and share.  The code was not optimized at all for
			speed, and I doubt any improvements in this area would
			increase the comprehension by readers.</p>

		<p>Label the graphs! Real numbers along x-axis, imaginary along y-axis.</p>
		<p>When I code up my algebra for complex powers I'll explore fractals based on the formula:
		<math mode=display>
			<msub><mi>z</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub> <mo>=</mo> <msup><msub><mi>z</mi><mi>n</mi> <mi>z</mi></msup> <mo>+</mo> <mi>c</mi>
		</math>
		<p>A good learning tool to include would be a graph that
		visualized the results for the complex arithmetic operators of
		addition and multiplication.  And maybe division.  That would
		show the opreations involved in each iterative step.</p>
